# "Here's the reality - I don't care about any of this stuff." ~ Bill Kennedy

### "Order the fields in your struct in a logical way that makes sense for **readability** and not in terms of padding. But if we ever found ourselves in a situation where we needed to reduce the amount of memory we were allocating, now this understanding of padding can allow us to do some form of micro-optimization." ~ Bill Kennedy

# Methods	

# Embedding Types & Inner-Type Promotion
You can include one struct type within another by **embedding it as a field without a field name.** This is known as "embedding" and it provides a way to reuse code and model is-a or has-a relationships. When you embed a type in another struct, the fields and methods of the embedded **"inner"** type become accessible as if they were part of the **"outer"** type. This is often referred to as "promotion."

### Basic Embedding
Here's a simple example to illustrate embedding:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Address struct {
    Street string
    City   string
    State  string
    Zip    string
}

type Person struct {
    Name    string
    Age     int
    Address // Embedding Address struct
}

func main() {
    p := Person{
        Name: "John",
        Age:  30,
        Address: Address{
            Street: "123 Main St",
            City:   "Anytown",
            State:  "CA",
            Zip:    "12345",
        },
    }

    fmt.Println("Name:", p.Name)
    fmt.Println("Age:", p.Age)
    fmt.Println("Street:", p.Street) // Note the promoted field
    fmt.Println("City:", p.City)       // Note the promoted field
}
```

In the above example, `Person` embeds `Address`. This allows us to directly access the `Street` and `City` fields on a `Person` object, as if they were fields of `Person` itself.

### Method Promotion
In addition to fields, methods are also promoted. If the embedded type has any methods, those become accessible as methods of the outer type.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Writer struct{}

func (w *Writer) Write(p []byte) (n int, err error) {
    n = len(p)
    fmt.Println(string(p))
    return n, nil
}

type AdvancedWriter struct {
    *Writer // Embedding Writer as a pointer
}

func main() {
    aw := &AdvancedWriter{&Writer{}}
    aw.Write([]byte("Hello, World!")) // Using Write method of embedded Writer
}
```

### Overriding Methods and Fields

You can also override methods and fields of the embedded type by declaring them in the outer type:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Animal struct{}

func (a *Animal) Speak() {
    fmt.Println("Animal speaks.")
}

type Dog struct {
    Animal // Embedding Animal
}

// Overriding Speak method
func (d *Dog) Speak() {
    fmt.Println("Woof woof!")
}

func main() {
    d := &Dog{}
    d.Speak() // Output will be "Woof woof!"
}
```

In this example, we have a `Dog` struct that embeds an `Animal` struct. Both `Animal` and `Dog` have a method named `Speak()`. When we call `Speak()` on a `Dog` object, it uses the method defined in the `Dog` struct, overriding the one from `Animal`.

### Limitations and Ambiguity

When you have two embedded types with fields or methods having the same name, you can't access them directly from the outer struct to avoid ambiguity. In such cases, you'll have to specify which embedded type's field or method you want to access:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Writer struct {
    Name string
}

func (w *Writer) Write() {
    fmt.Println("Writer is writing.")
}

type Reader struct {
    Name string
}

func (r *Reader) Read() {
    fmt.Println("Reader is reading.")
}

type WriterReader struct {
    Writer
    Reader
}

func main() {
    wr := &WriterReader{
        Writer: Writer{Name: "Writer"},
        Reader: Reader{Name: "Reader"},
    }

    // Ambiguous field
    // fmt.Println(wr.Name) // This will throw an error

    // Disambiguate
    fmt.Println(wr.Writer.Name)
    fmt.Println(wr.Reader.Name)

    // Methods aren't ambiguous
    wr.Write()
    wr.Read()
}
```

In this example, both `Writer` and `Reader` have a field named `Name`. If you try to access `Name` directly from `WriterReader`, it will result in a compilation error due to ambiguity. You have to specify whether you mean `Writer.Name` or `Reader.Name`.

So that's a quick overview of field embedding and inner type promotion in Go. It's a very powerful feature and it's used extensively in idiomatic Go code.


# Composite Types & Aggregate Types

In the context of the Go programming language, the terms "composite types" and "aggregate types" are often used interchangeably. However, it's worth breaking down the nuances of these two terms to clarify the distinction.

### Composite Types

The term "composite types" refers to types that can be composed of other types. In Go, these are:

- Arrays
- Slices
- Maps
- Structs
- Channels

These types allow you to bundle multiple values, possibly of multiple types, into a single variable.

### Aggregate Types

The term "aggregate types" is not strictly defined in Go's language specification. However, in general computer science terms, an "aggregate type" is a type that groups together variables under a single name. In C or C++, for example, this would be a `struct` or an `array`.

In the context of Go, you might consider arrays and structs as aggregate types because they "aggregate" multiple values of the same or different types, respectively.

### Summary

In summary, while all aggregate types (in the general sense) could be considered composite types in Go, not all composite types would traditionally be considered aggregate types. For example, channels and maps in Go could be considered composite but not aggregate, as they don't just bundle existing types togetherâ€”they provide additional functionality and behavior.

In practice, the terms are often used interchangeably, and the specific meaning is usually clear from the context in which they are used.

In the context of the Go programming language, the concepts of mechanical sympathy, alignment, and padding bytes all come under the larger umbrella of system-level optimizations. Understanding these can lead to more performant code, better resource utilization, and improved interoperability with hardware components.

# Mechanical Sympathy, Alignment, & Padding Bytes

### Mechanical Sympathy

Mechanical sympathy refers to writing code that is sympathetic to the underlying hardware it runs on. In other words, it's about understanding enough of the hardware's behavior to write software that runs efficiently on that hardware. For Go programmers, mechanical sympathy often entails understanding the machine-level implications of their code: how data is laid out in memory, how the Go runtime schedules Goroutines onto OS threads, how network packets are transmitted over the wire, etc.

### Alignment

In computer memory, data is usually read in "chunks" that align with the architecture's word size. For example, on a 64-bit machine, data is most efficiently accessed when it is aligned on 64-bit (8-byte) boundaries. Misaligned access usually results in slower performance due to additional CPU cycles spent in rearranging the data.

In Go, the language runtime and compiler handle most of the alignment issues, but you should still be aware of it, especially when you're working with low-level programming involving direct memory access or when you're trying to optimize data structures. The `unsafe.Alignof` function can help you understand the alignment of different types in Go.

```go
import (
	"fmt"
	"unsafe"
)

type Example struct {
	A bool    // 1 byte
	B int32   // 4 bytes
	C float64 // 8 bytes
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Alignment of bool:", unsafe.Alignof(bool(true)))
	fmt.Println("Alignment of int32:", unsafe.Alignof(int32(0)))
	fmt.Println("Alignment of float64:", unsafe.Alignof(float64(0.0)))
	fmt.Println("Alignment of Example:", unsafe.Alignof(Example{}))
}
```

### Padding Bytes

To maintain alignment, compilers may insert "padding" bytes between fields of a struct. Padding bytes are essentially unused spaces that exist to ensure that the data structure aligns properly with the machine's word size. This can lead to larger-than-expected memory consumption, which can be critical in systems that are memory-constrained.

You can sometimes reduce the size of a struct by reordering its fields in a way that minimizes padding. Go's language specification does not guarantee the layout of the struct fields in memory, but in practice, you'll often find that the fields are laid out in the order they are defined.

```go
// Without optimization
type Unoptimized struct {
	A bool    // 1 byte
	B float64 // 8 bytes
	C int32   // 4 bytes
	// Padding: 3 bytes for A, 4 bytes for C (assuming 64-bit machine)
}

// With optimization
type Optimized struct {
	B float64 // 8 bytes
	C int32   // 4 bytes
	A bool    // 1 byte
	// Padding: None or minimal (assuming 64-bit machine)
}
```

Understanding mechanical sympathy, alignment, and padding bytes can help you write Go code that runs more efficiently, especially in system-critical or resource-constrained environments.

# CPU Cycles & CPU Operations Per Cycle

The terms "CPU cycles" and "CPU operations" are often used interchangeably but they have distinct meanings in the context of computer architecture and performance analysis.

### CPU Cycles

A CPU cycle is the smallest unit of time for a CPU and is measured by the clock rate, often represented in gigahertz (GHz). For example, a 3 GHz CPU completes 3 billion cycles per second. During each cycle, the CPU can perform a certain amount of work, such as fetching instructions from memory, decoding instructions, executing instructions, or writing data back to memory.

However, not all actions can be completed in a single CPU cycle. Modern CPUs have multiple stages in their pipeline to fetch, decode, execute, and retire instructions. This allows them to work on multiple instructions simultaneously but also means that individual instructions may take multiple cycles to complete.

### CPU Operations

CPU operations refer to the actual tasks that a CPU performs, typically represented as instructions in machine code. These operations include arithmetic calculations, data movement, logical operations, and control flow changes, among others. Each operation may correspond to a specific machine language instruction or a set of instructions that the CPU can execute.

The relationship between CPU cycles and operations can be complex:

1. **CPI (Cycles Per Instruction)**: Not all operations are completed in one cycle. Some might require multiple cycles, depending on the complexity of the operation and the CPU architecture. The CPI metric gives an average number of cycles needed for an instruction.

2. **Superscalar Architecture**: Modern CPUs can often execute multiple instructions per cycle, thanks to features like multiple execution units and out-of-order execution.

3. **Instruction Pipelining**: Modern CPUs use pipelining to break down each operation into smaller steps, allowing the CPU to work on different stages of multiple instructions simultaneously.

4. **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**: Different CPUs may have different sets of operations, and some may even have specialized instructions that perform a complex task in a single operation, affecting the operation-to-cycle ratio.

### Summary

- **CPU Cycles**: A unit of time for the CPU, measured in clock speed (GHz). Defines how many cycles the CPU has in one second to perform tasks.
  
- **CPU Operations**: The actual tasks or instructions that a CPU performs. These can vary in complexity and may take multiple cycles to complete.

Understanding both concepts is crucial for performance tuning and optimization, both in software and hardware design.

# Understanding The Alignof Function

The `unsafe.Alignof` function in Go's `unsafe` package returns the alignment of a type in bytes. The alignment is the smallest number `n` such that an address `a` for a variable of that type will always be a multiple of `n`. Understanding alignment can be crucial for low-level programming, performance tuning, and interacting with C code using cgo.

Here's a basic example:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"unsafe"
)

func main() {
	var x int32
	var y int64
	var z float64

	fmt.Println("Alignment of int32:", unsafe.Alignof(x))
	fmt.Println("Alignment of int64:", unsafe.Alignof(y))
	fmt.Println("Alignment of float64:", unsafe.Alignof(z))
}
```

This will usually output:

```
Alignment of int32: 4
Alignment of int64: 8
Alignment of float64: 8
```

In this example, the alignment of `int32` is 4 bytes, `int64` is 8 bytes, and `float64` is 8 bytes as well. This means that, in memory, the starting address of a variable of type `int32` will be a multiple of 4, for `int64` it will be a multiple of 8, and for `float64`, it will be a multiple of 8.

On a 64-bit machine, that is a machine that has a word size of 64 bits or 8 bytes, this means is that 

- The int32 needs to be stored at byte location 0 or 4 in a word. 
- The int64 and float64 need to be stored at byte location 0 in a word.

A variable's starting address in memory must align with its alignment requirement. That is, the starting address should be a multiple of the alignment value. This ensures that the CPU can access the data efficiently, often in a single cycle, without having to deal with misalignment penalties.

### To further explain this example

1. **int32**: If a variable of type `int32` has an alignment of 4 bytes, it means that the starting address of this variable in memory would be a multiple of 4 (e.g., 0, 4, 8, 12, ...).

2. **int64 and float64**: Similarly, if a variable of type `int64` or `float64` has an alignment of 8 bytes, the starting address in memory would be a multiple of 8 (e.g., 0, 8, 16, 24, ...).

### Illustrations & Explanations #1

```go
	type Example struct {
		A bool    // 1 byte
		B int16   // 2 bytes
		C float32 // 4 bytes
	}
	// padding: 1 byte for A
```

In the `Example` struct, padding might be introduced to ensure that each field aligns with memory locations that are multiples of their respective sizes. When needed, the alignment requirement is typically the same as the size of the type for built-in types.

Here's how the memory layout might look, assuming the machine architecture requires alignment:

1. **Field `A` (bool)**: Takes 1 byte of memory, but will likely have 1 byte of padding after it to ensure that `B` starts at an address that is a multiple of 2.
  
   - `A`: 1 byte
   - Padding after `A`: 1 byte

2. **Field `B` (int16)**: Takes 2 bytes of memory and is aligned on a 2-byte boundary.

   - `B`: 2 bytes

3. **Field `C` (float32)**: Takes 4 bytes of memory and would typically be aligned on a 4-byte boundary.

   - `C`: 4 bytes

So, the struct might have 1 byte of padding after the `bool` field `A` to ensure that `B` starts at an address that is a multiple of 2.

Total Size: 1 byte (A) + 1 byte (padding) + 2 bytes (B) + 4 bytes (C) = 8 bytes

Please note that the Go language specification doesn't guarantee the layout of structs in memory, so the actual layout might differ depending on compiler optimizations and the target architecture. However, the layout above is commonly seen in practice on systems that require data alignment.


### Illustrations & Explanations #2

```go
	type Example struct {
		A bool    // 1 byte
		B int32   // 4 bytes
		C float32 // 4 bytes
	}
	// padding: 3 bytes for A
```

Let's examine the potential padding:

1. **Field `A` (bool)**: Takes 1 byte of memory, but will likely have 3 bytes of padding after it to ensure that `B` starts at an address that is a multiple of 4.
  
   - `A`: 1 byte
   - Padding after `A`: 3 bytes

2. **Field `B` (int32)**: Takes 4 bytes of memory and would typically be aligned on a 4-byte boundary.
  
   - `B`: 4 bytes

3. **Field `C` (float32)**: Tkes 4 bytes of memory and would typically be aligned on a 4-byte boundary.
  
   - `C`: 4 bytes

Here's how the struct would likely be laid out in memory, assuming the machine architecture requires alignment:

Memory layout:

```
+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
|   A  | pad  | pad  | pad  |   B (4 bytes)    |   C (4 bytes)    |
+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
1 byte   3 bytes       4 bytes          4 bytes
```

Total Size: 1 byte (A) + 3 bytes (padding) + 4 bytes (B) + 4 bytes (C) = 12 bytes

Again, the Go language specification doesn't guarantee specific memory layouts for structs, so the actual layout might differ depending on compiler optimizations and the target architecture. However, this layout would be typical for systems that require data to be aligned.

### Illustrations & Explanations #3

```go
	type Example struct {
		A bool    // 1 byte
		B int32   // 4 bytes
		C float64 // 8 bytes
	}
```

The padding and alignment would look like this:

1. **Field `A` (bool)**: Takes 1 byte of memory, but will likely have 3 bytes of padding after it to ensure that `B` starts at an address that is a multiple of 4.

    - `A`: 1 byte
    - Padding after `A`: 3 bytes

2. **Field `B` (int32)**: Takes 4 bytes of memory and would be aligned on a 4-byte boundary.

    - `B`: 4 bytes

3. **Field `C` (float64)**: Takes 8 bytes of memory and would typically be aligned on an 8-byte boundary. 

    - `C`: 8 bytes

Here's how the struct would likely be laid out in memory:

```
+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
|   A  | pad  | pad  | pad  |   B (4 bytes)    |          C (8 bytes)          |
+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
1 byte   3 bytes       4 bytes                          8 bytes
```

Total Size: 1 byte (A) + 3 bytes (padding) + 4 bytes (B) + 8 bytes (C) = 16 bytes

### Illustrations & Explanations #4 - Unoptimized

```go
type Unoptimized struct {
		A bool    // 1 byte
		B float64 // 8 bytes
		C int32   // 4 bytes
		// Padding: 7 bytes for A, 4 bytes for C (assuming 64-bit machine)
	}
```

In the `Unoptimized` struct, padding and alignment might look like this based on typical alignment requirements for the respective types:

1. **Field `A` (bool)**: Takes 1 byte of memory, but will likely have 7 bytes of padding after it to ensure that `B` starts at an address that is a multiple of 8.

    - `A`: 1 byte
    - Padding after `A`: 7 bytes

2. **Field `B` (float64)**: Takes 8 bytes of memory and would typically be aligned on an 8-byte boundary.

    - `B`: 8 bytes

3. **Field `C` (int32)**: Takes 4 bytes of memory and would typically be aligned on a 4-byte boundary.

    - `C`: 4 bytes

Here's how the struct would likely be laid out in memory:

Memory layout:

```
+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
|   A  | pad  | pad  | pad  | pad  | pad  | pad  | pad  |          B (8 bytes)             | C (4 bytes) | pad  | pad  | pad  | pad  |
+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
1 byte   7 bytes                         8 bytes                           4 bytes 4 bytes
```

Total Size: 1 byte (A) + 7 bytes (padding) + 8 bytes (B) + 4 bytes (C) + 4 bytes (padding) = 24 bytes

```bash
EXAMPLE 4 - Unoptimized
Alignment of bool: 1
Alignment of float64: 8
Alignment of int32: 4
Alignment of Unoptimized: 8
Size of Unoptimized: 24
```
***The entire struct also has to fall on an alignment for the largest field that is in that struct***

### Illustrations & Explanations #4 - Optimized

```go
	type Optimized struct {
		B float64 // 8 bytes
		C int32   // 4 bytes
		A bool    // 1 byte
		// Padding: None or minimal (assuming 64-bit machine)
	}
```

In the `Optimized` struct, we've rearranged the fields to minimize padding. Let's examine the alignment and padding based on typical alignment requirements:

1. **Field `B` (float64)**: Takes 8 bytes of memory and would typically be aligned on an 8-byte boundary.
  
    - `B`: 8 bytes

2. **Field `C` (int32)**: Takes 4 bytes of memory and would typically be aligned on a 4-byte boundary. In this case, it would also naturally fall into an address that is a multiple of 4, assuming `B` started at an 8-byte-aligned address.
  
    - `C`: 4 bytes

3. **Field `A` (bool)**: Takes 1 byte of memory. Given that `C` ends on a 4-byte boundary, `A` would start at the next byte.
  
    - `A`: 1 byte
    - Padding after `A`: To align the size of the entire struct to a multiple of the largest field (float64, which has an alignment requirement of 8 bytes), you would have 3 bytes of padding at the end of the struct.

Here's how the struct would likely be laid out in memory:

Memory layout:

```
+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
|                    B (8 bytes)                    |        C (4 bytes)         |   A  | pad  | pad  | pad  |
+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
                        8 bytes                               4 bytes          1 byte   3 bytes
```

Total Size: 8 bytes (B) + 4 bytes (C) + 1 byte (A) + 3 bytes (padding) = 16 bytes

By rearranging the fields like this, we have minimized the padding needed, and the size of the struct is now 16 bytes instead of 20 bytes, as it was in the previous `Unoptimized` version. This is a typical optimization for systems that require data to be aligned.

### Why is this Important?

1. **Performance**: Misaligned reads and writes can be slower because they may require multiple CPU cycles and additional operations to complete.

2. **Hardware Requirements**: Some hardware architectures do not even support misaligned access and will trigger a runtime fault if attempted.

3. **Interoperability**: When interfacing with low-level languages like C or when doing system programming, knowing the alignment is essential for data structure compatibility.

4. **Memory Layout**: Understanding alignment can help you design data structures that require less padding, thereby using memory more efficiently.

### Caveats

- Using `unsafe` should be done carefully, as incorrect use can lead to various problems like undefined behavior and difficult-to-debug issues.
  
- Go does a good job of handling alignment automatically in most cases, so you typically don't need to worry about it for day-to-day coding tasks.

- The result of `unsafe.Alignof` is Go-implementation and architecture-specific. Therefore, it might differ when you switch from one Go implementation or CPU architecture to another.

Understanding alignment via `unsafe.Alignof` can provide insights into the memory layout and potential performance characteristics of your Go programs, but it's generally not something you need to worry about unless you are working on very low-level or performance-critical code.

### The meaning of `scan up` 

This is in relation to [this package here: https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/fieldalignment](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/fieldalignment)

The comment describes an analyzer tool that checks Go structs for how they could be optimized in terms of memory usage. Specifically, it talks about two different metrics:

1. The size of the struct: how much memory it uses.
2. The number of "pointer bytes": the amount of memory the garbage collector needs to scan to find all the pointers within the struct.

In Go, some types have "inner pointers," meaning that the actual data is not stored inline within the struct but rather is pointed to by a pointer within the object. For example, a `string` in Go is effectively a struct containing a pointer to an array of characters (the actual string data) and a length. When the garbage collector is looking for pointers, it not only has to look at the memory occupied by the struct itself but also follow these inner pointers to scan the additional memory that these pointers reference.

The phrase "scan up through the string's inner pointer" means that the garbage collector has to follow the internal pointer within the `string` type to scan the underlying data for more pointers. The term "scan up" here probably refers to the operation of following a pointer to look at the data it references, rather than scanning in any specific "upward" or "downward" direction in memory.

Let's consider the examples:

- `struct { uint32; string }`: This struct has a `uint32` (4 bytes) and a `string` (which contains a pointer, typically 8 bytes on a 64-bit system, and a length, usually also 8 bytes). The struct itself occupies 4 + 8 + 8 = 20 bytes, but the garbage collector has to consider the internal pointer of the `string`, making it "16 pointer bytes" that have to be scanned.
  
- `struct { string; *uint32 }`: This struct contains a `string` (16 bytes as explained before) and a pointer to a `uint32` (8 bytes on a 64-bit system). Therefore, the garbage collector has to scan both the internal pointer of the `string` and the pointer to `uint32`, totaling "24 pointer bytes."

- `struct { string; uint32 }`: Here, the garbage collector can stop immediately after scanning the internal pointer of the `string` as `uint32` doesn't contain any pointers. Thus, it only has "8 pointer bytes" to scan.

The comment also wisely notes that while rearranging the fields for minimal memory usage might seem beneficial, it can have other side effects like "false sharing," a form of memory contention. In a multi-threaded environment like Go's goroutines, false sharing can lead to performance issues.
